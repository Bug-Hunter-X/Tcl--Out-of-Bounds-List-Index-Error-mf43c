This repository contains a simple Tcl procedure that demonstrates an out-of-bounds list index error and its solution. The `bug.tcl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from insufficient bounds checking when accessing elements of a list using `lindex`.  This is a common error that can lead to unexpected crashes or incorrect results.
